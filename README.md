# ❱ Plex Assistant

Plex Assistant is a Home Assistant component to allow Google Assistant to cast Plex media to Google cast and Plex devices with a bit of help from [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or DialogFlow.

Example: `"Hey Google, tell Plex to play The Walking Dead on the Downstairs TV."`

You can use the component's service without IFTTT/DialogFlow as well to call the commands however you'd like. Visit the services tab in HA's Developer Tools to test it out.

## Author's note
This is just a side project made to fill the absence of native Google Assistant support in Plex and because the Phlex/FlexTV projects aren't in working order at the moment (is it just me?). It has only been tested on my setup with first generation Chromecasts.

This project is not a priority as Plex could add Google Assistant support or FlexTV may become viable again at any time. That being said, I will be adding features and fixing issues until that time. As always, I both welcome and greatly appreciate pull requests.

Thank you for understanding.

**Sample Config**
```
plex_assistant:
  url: 'http://192.168.1.3:32400'
  token: 'tH1s1Sy0uRT0k3n'
  default_cast: 'Downstairs TV'

  tts_errors: true
  aliases:

***You must restart after installation and configuration, you may want to setup IFTTT or DialogFlow with the instructions below before doing so.*** 

## IFTTT/DialogFlow-Setup

You can either use IFTTT or DialogFlow to trigger Plex Assistant. DialogFlow is more involved and finicky to setup than IFTTT. It's advantages are quicker response and support for more languages as long as the translation has been made for Plex Assistant.

  <summary><b>IFTTT Setup Guide</b></summary>
  
## IFTTT Setup

#### In Home Assistant

* Go to "Configuration" in your HA sidebar and select "Integrations"
* Hit the add button and search for "IFTTT" and click configure.
* Follow the on screen instructions.
* Copy or save the URL that is displayed at the end, we'll need it later and it won't be shown again.
* Click "Finish"

#### In IFTTT

Visit [ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com/) and sign up or sign in.

* Click "Explore" in the top right, then hit the plus sign to make your own applet from scratch
* Press the plus sign next to "If". Search for and select "Google Assistant"
* Select "Say phrase with text ingredient"

Now you can select how you want to trigger this service, you can select up to 3 ways to invoke it. I use things like `tell plex to $` or `have plex $`. The dollar sign will be the phrase sent to this component. See currently supported [commands below](#commands)). You can also set a response from the Google Assistant if you'd like. Hit "Create Trigger" to continue.

* Press the plus sign next to "Then"
* Search for and select "Webhooks", then select "Make a web request"
* In the URL field enter the webhook URL HA provided you earlier
* Select method "Post" and content type "application/json"
* Then copy and paste the code below into the body field

`{ "action": "call_service", "service": "plex_assistant.command", "command": "{{TextField}}" }`

#### In Home Assistant

Finally, add the following automation to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml:

```
automation:
  - alias: Plex Assistant Automation
    trigger:
    - event_data:
        action: call_service
      event_type: ifttt_webhook_received
      platform: event
    condition:
      condition: template
      value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.service == 'plex_assistant.command' }}"
    action:
    - data_template:
        command: "{{ trigger.event.data.command }}"
      service_template: '{{ trigger.event.data.service }}'
```

***Either refresh your automations or restart after adding the automation.***

* Now select "Intents" in the sidebar and hit the "Create Intent" button.
* Select "ADD PARAMETERS AND ACTION" and enter "Plex" as the action name.
* Check the checkbox under "Required"
* Under "Parameter Name" put "command", under "Entity" put "@sys.any", and under "Value" put "$command"
* Now click "ADD TRAINING PHRASES"
* Create a phrase and type in "command"
* Then double click on the word "command" you just entered and select "@sys.any:command"
* Scroll to the bottom and expand "Fulfillment" then click "ENABLE FULFILLMENT"
* Turn on "Enable webhook call for this intent"
* At the top of the page enter "Plex" for the intent name and hit "Save".

* Type "Plex" in "Implicit invocation", then click "Manage assistant app"
* Click "Decide how your action is invoked"
* Under "Display Name" type "Plex" then hit save in the top right (it may give an error, but thats okay).

#### In Home Assistant

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file

```
intent_script:
  Plex:
    speech:
      text: Command sent to Plex.
    action:
      - service_template: plex_assistant.command
        data_template:
          command: "{{command}}"
```

***Restart after adding the above.***

## Commands

#### Fuzzy Matching
A show or movie's title and the Chromecast device used in your phrase are processed using a fuzzy search. Meaning it will select the closest match using your Plex media titles and available cast device names. `"play walk in deed on the dawn tee"` would become `"Play The Walking Dead on the Downstairs TV."`. This even works for partial matches. `play Pets 2` will match `The Secret Life of Pets 2`.

#### You can say things like:
* `"play the latest episode of Breaking Bad on the Living Room TV"`
* `"play unwatched breaking bad"`
* `"play Breaking Bad"`
* `"play Pets 2 on the Kitchen Chromecast"`
* `"play ondeck"`
* `"play ondeck movies"`
* `"play season 1 episode 3 of The Simpsons"`
* `"play first season second episode of Taskmaster on the Theater System"`

### Control Commands:
* `play`
* `pause`
* `stop`
* `jump forward`
* `jump back`

Be sure to add the name of the device to control commands if it is not the default device. `"stop downstairs tv"`.

I've tried to take into account many different ways that commands could be phrased. If you find a phrase that isn't working and you feel should be implemented, please make an issue.

***Music isn't built in yet, only shows and movies at the moment.***

#### Cast Device
If no cast device is specified the default_cast device set in config is used. A cast device will only be found if at the end of the command and when preceded with the phrase `"on"` or `"on the"`. Example: *"play friends **ON** downstairs tv"*
