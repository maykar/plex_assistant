# ‚ù± Plex Assistant

Plex Assistant is a Home Assistant component to allow Google Assistant to cast Plex media to Google cast and Plex devices with a bit of help from [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or DialogFlow.

Example: `"Hey Google, tell Plex to play The Walking Dead on the Downstairs TV."`

You can use the component's service without IFTTT/DialogFlow to call the commands however you'd like. Visit the services tab in HA's Developer Tools to test it out.
